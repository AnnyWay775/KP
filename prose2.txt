My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
My sceptre for a palmer's walking-staff,
The King shall be contented. Must he lose
My subjects for a pair of carved saints,
My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
What must the King do now? Must he submit?
A little, little grave, an obscure grave;
The name of king? O God's name, let it go.
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
And my large kingdom for a little grave,
The King shall do it. Must he be deposed?
